# Quick Notes
Quick Notes is a plugin written for IntelliJ IDEA. This plugin adds the ability to manage multiple text notes
within the IDEA itself. These could be some tips, notes, code snippets, etc that usually comes to mind while
coding and Quick Notes provides an ideal way to save those thoughts quickly and with ease.

Quick Notes is compatible with multiple opened IDEA instances, so any change made to any note in one instance
of IDEA gets reflected in the other IDEA instances without any delay.
